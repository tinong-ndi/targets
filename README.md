Deploying the Web Application on Amazon ECS
Prepare Your Dockerized Web Application: Make sure your web application is containerized using Docker and the Docker image is stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

Create an ECS Task Definition: Define an ECS task definition that includes the details of your Docker image, container settings, environment variables, and resource requirements.

Set Up an ECS Cluster: Create an ECS cluster, which is a logical grouping of container instances. These instances will host your application's tasks.

Create an ECS Service: Launch an ECS service using the task definition and cluster you've set up. This service will manage the tasks and ensure they run continuously.

Monitoring Your Application with CloudWatch
Visualize ECS Metrics: Use Amazon CloudWatch to create custom dashboards that visualize metrics related to your ECS service, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task count.

Set Up Alarms: Configure CloudWatch alarms to be notified when specific thresholds are breached. For example, you can set up alarms to trigger when CPU utilization is consistently high or when the number of tasks changes rapidly.

Auto-Scaling Your ECS Service
Create a CloudWatch Alarm: Define a CloudWatch alarm that monitors the CPU utilization of your ECS service.

Set Up an Auto-Scaling Policy: Create an auto-scaling policy for your ECS service based on the CloudWatch alarm. When the CPU utilization exceeds a certain threshold, ECS will automatically scale out the number of tasks to handle the increased load.
